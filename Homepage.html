                <h2>Welcome the Morningside eSports Directory</h2>
                <p>The Morningside's esports program began its journey in 2014, when the idea of forming a competitive video gaming team was first proposed. By 2016, after a year of growing interest, the program officially launched as a student-run club, driven by the passion of both students and staff. Promotion during this early phase relied heavily on word-of-mouth, with dedicated students even building the necessary gaming rigs over a single unpaid weekend.
                    The teamâ€™s hard work paid off when they joined the National Esports Collegiate Conference (NECC), marking their first successful inaugural season.
                    In the nearly ten years since, the esports program has evolved into a formally recognized collegiate athletic team, competing in numerous official seasons and offering scholarships to student players.
