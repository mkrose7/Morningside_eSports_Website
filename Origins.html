            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>The Morningside University eSports team traces its origins back to 2014, when Dean Stevens proposed the idea to professors David Elder and Richard Yates.
                The three regularly played League of Legends together, and their shared passion for the game helped spark the foundation of what would become the eSports program. 
                At the time, Morningside offered a video game production and animation major designed to prepare students for careers in game development.
                 Inspired by this, Stevens envisioned an eSports club that would unite these students through competitive gaming. 
                 Without immediate funding, the idea began as a grassroots effort.

                By 2015, interest in the club was spreading—mostly through word of mouth—as students expressed enthusiasm about joining a professional video game league.
                 The club officially launched in 2016, marked by a build day where members assembled gaming chairs, built PCs, and helped bring the team’s dedicated gaming space—The Nexus—to life. 
                 Those who contributed to building the machines were given the chance to name them—Richard Yates named one “Ragey,” combining the first initials of his family members’ names. 
                 That same year, Morningside joined the NECC league, laying the groundwork for future competition.

                The team’s first official title was League of Legends, followed by Overwatch, where they competed at a high level. 
                Their NECC debut included a strong kickoff season and a trip to Pennsylvania—though Yates was unable to attend, as he was transitioning out of the program after the university decided to discontinue the video game major. 
                In 2017, Rocket League was added to the lineup, marking their first full year of competitive play. By 2020, the program had outgrown the initial support structure under Dean Stevens, and Jared Amundson stepped in to help guide its continued growth. 
                Today, Morningside eSports stands as a testament to student passion, collaboration, and a love for gaming.
